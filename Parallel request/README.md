# Parallel requests in Grafana k6 performance testing tool
# Introduction
 This template will help you to implement a parrell/concurrent request in k6. It is a modern load testing tool,You can use k6 to evaluate your systemsâ€™ reliability and performance, catching performance regressions and problems earlier. To make performance testing more efficient, we may utilize concurrent request , with the help of concurrent requests  we may reach the application server faster, potentially increasing server resource use.
# Why should we use parallel requests?
parallel requests in production, because parallel requests make a test more realistic in certain instances. Because modern browsers support parallelism by default, a load test for a website or web app should usually account for parallel requests.
<strong>API calls may not typically be triggered simultaneously, so it may be more realistic to send requests sequentially.</strong>
# Technologies Used
> Programming language - Javascript

> Automation tool - grafana-k6

> IDE - Visual Studio Code(vs-code)
# Libraries Used
# http
    import http from 'k6/http';
# check
    import { check } from 'k6';

# Steps for execution
Clone the repository on your local system. vs-code will resolve all the required dependencies and then Download k6.

install k6
Mac
Install with Homebrew by running:

brew install k6
# Windows
If you use the Chocolatey package manager you can install the unofficial k6 package with:

  choco install k6
Otherwise, you can manually download and install the latest official .msi package.

# Linux
For Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu, you can install k6 from the private deb repo like this:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69
echo "deb https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install k6
open terminal in project location and type k6 run FileName.js

Now the tests will be execute on your machine.

you can change url and checks and also add some thresholds in the code and variable name as per your needs.
